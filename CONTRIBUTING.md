### How to Add a New Project

#### Option 1: Using GitHub Issues (Recommended)

The easiest way to add a new project is by creating a Project Request issue:

1. Go to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/InftyAI/Awesome-LLMOps/issues)
2. Click "New Issue" and select "Project Request"
3. Fill out the template with your project information
4. Submit the issue

GitHub Actions workflow will automatically process your request, create a PR, and add the project to the appropriate category.

#### Option 2: Manual Addition

To add a new project to the landscape, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the project logo**:
   - Create or obtain a logo for the project (PNG or SVG format recommended)
   - Image should be square or have transparent background
   - Place the logo file in the `logos/` directory with a descriptive name

2. **Update `data.yml`**:
   - Find the appropriate category and subcategory for your project
   - Add a new entry under the `items` section with the following format:
   ```yaml
   - name: Project Name
     description: A brief description of the project (1-2 sentences)
     homepage_url: https://github.com/org/repo
     logo: project-logo.png
     repo_url: https://github.com/org/repo
   ```

3. **Update the main README.md**:
   - Add the project to the appropriate category in the main README.md
